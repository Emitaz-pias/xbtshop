    answer: (
      <Box sx={{ color: 'text.secondary' }}>
        <Typography paragraph>
          An agent's income depends directly on their customer base and the
          betting company that they are working with. There are several ways for
          an agent to increase their income:
        </Typography>
        <Box
          component="ol"
          sx={{
            listStyleType: 'decimal',
            pl: 3,
            '& li': { mb: 1.5, pl: 1 },
          }}
        >
          <li>
            <Typography>
              Expand your player base. An agent's income comes from the
              commission on bettors' transactions. The more bettors, the more
              transactions, and, of course, the more profit for the agent.
            </Typography>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Typography>
              Build and expand an agent network. By attracting new cashiers and
              forming their own network, an agent can widen their player base,
              increase the number of transactions, and, of course, increase their
              profit. The agent decides the amount of commission to pay to
              cashiers.

              Work with a betting company that offers a large sportsbook. The
              better the company, the more customers it will attract; the more
              betting options it offers, the more bets its customers will place.
              This allows an agent to make more money. Reputation, history, and
              popularity of the bookmaker are also important. All this can make
              the search for customers easier for the agent.
